# subtitle-downloader
One click subtitle downloader

Inspired from [manojmj92/subtitle-downloader](https://github.com/manojmj92/subtitle-downloader) which is a python script to download subtitles of any movie or tv series.

I thought to rewrite the same script in PHP using the same API and providing the same functionality.

## How to use
### Windows :
- Install php and set its path so that `php` keyword can be use as command.
- Put `subtitle-downloader.php` in C:\
- Put `Subtitle Downloader.cmd` in SendTo folder, you can access it by executing `shell:sendto` in windows address bar.
- Now you just have to navigate to the folder where the movie or tv series file is stored right click on that file and  click `Sent to -> Subtitle Downloader.cmd`.

That's all it will download a `.srt` file of subtitle for you in the same place where the video file is placed with same name as video file.
